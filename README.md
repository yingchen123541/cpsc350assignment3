purpose: open a file and see whether all the delimiters are matched up in that file
         let the user know when there's extra delimiters or need additional delimiters in certain lines
         exit the program and let the user fix the error then read from a file again

            got help from Lucas Torti on pop method

errors: didn't do a template class
        error handling doesn't work
        get filename from user input instead of from command line argument
